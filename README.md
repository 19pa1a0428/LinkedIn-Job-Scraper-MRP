Run search_retriever.py to find new job postings and insert most recent ids to db

Run details_retriever.py to populate table with individual job api call

While ```search_retriever.py``` should not cause any problems even through your personal IP and a singular account, ```details_retriever.py``` can be finicky since every search yields â‰ˆ25-50 results, which all need to be called individually to obtain their attributes. I recommend utilizing multiple proxys and accounts with ```details_retriever.py``` and playing around with the delay. Keep in mind it can continue running during lower activity hours and weekends to catch up with ```search_retriever.py```.
